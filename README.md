# NSS Exercise: JS Boybands and Vegetables

### Description:
> Loop through the two arrays provided (`bands` and `vegetables`) and output each element in the arrays into their corresponding HTML `<div>` element. Ensure that each item is in a block element (e.g. li, div, p. etc...) 

### Final Result:
> Singular for loop that adds both elements to the DOM. Either array can be added to without the other outputting undefined.
